done with core two routes to create a protected url , and return and store correspnding slug . 

Now the next part , is that maybe add teacher table , and tie created test to teahcer , and also add auth. 
Then the later backend focu should be on creating a route to report the violations . 

now added the violation table , and the endpoint to increment the counter of violation type . 
-- Have kept the schema to store images later on in the violation eveidece table.
